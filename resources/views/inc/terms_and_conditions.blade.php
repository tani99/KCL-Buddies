                The data you submit in this questionnaire is required to allow you to
                participate in the Buddy Scheme. Whilst this data is used by scheme
                coordinators to aid them in the automatic pairing process, they are not
                able to view your individual responses to questions.
                <br>
                We will retain your individual response to this questionnaire
                until 1 September of the following academic year. After that
                date, summary charts and statistics may be retained
                for the purposes of evaluating the success of the Buddy
                Scheme, whilst ensuring that no individual participant
                can be identified.
